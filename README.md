## Overview

This project aims to predict the stock prices of Amazon (AMZN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Bitcoin (BTC), and Netflix (NTFX) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The dataset used for this project contains adjusted stock prices from May 2013 to May 2019, sourced from Kaggle. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock price data to forecast future prices.ster.

## Dataset

About this Dataset
Data set with historical price information for 3 high growth stocks and bitcoin from May 2013 to May 2019. Basic analysis of returns and visualizations included.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored relationships through visualizations to gain insights.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data that might enhance predictive performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Evaluated different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to identify the best performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to evaluate model performance.
